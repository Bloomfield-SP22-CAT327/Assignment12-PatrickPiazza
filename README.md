# Assignment13-PatrickPiazza

The changes I have made are as follows:

1. Players move much faster
2. Enemies spawn more frequently
3. the score now serves as ammo of sorts, you start with 500 points and lose 25 every time you shoot, everytime you hit qan enemy, you'll gain 50 points. If your score hits 0, you can't shoot anymore, basically meaning you've lost.
4. Enemies can now spawn in different positions on the z-axis, meaning some can be farther away than others.
